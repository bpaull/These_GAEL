# Conclusion {#conclusion5}

This thesis has been for me the opportunity to shape my understanding of 
economic research; 
in particular the impact of different approaches to experiments in economics. 
When I started my thesis, I was focused on developing experimental protocols 
that would allow me to measure subjects' preferences as accurately as possible. 
To design these protocols I relied heavily on theoretical work concerning the 
models I wanted to test. 
My goal was to place my subjects in a situation as close as possible to the 
theoretical model while exploring as much as possible the impact of the 
different parameters of the model on individual preferences. 
<!-- The sentence below is still unclear -- better than the last iteration, but still a bit circular and not very clear. 
What do you want to say? that chapt2 suffers because it is over-reliant on econ theory. Then say so explicitly. 
Else it is "bad because approach, and approach bad" and it is not really informative. Which approach? Why does it limit the robustness? to the cost of being a bit repetitive, it is better to be precise and clearly convey the message. -->
The experiment presented in chapter 2 is an example of this approach and it 
suffers from this approach which limits the robustness of the analysis of the 
data in this chapter. 
My collaboration with Rustam Romaniuc, Dimitri Dubois and Paolo Crosetto 
encouraged me to develop an experimental design for the temptation model of 
@gul2001temptation but which aimed at highlighting the demand for commitment and
the capacity of individuals to exercise self-control. 
<!-- comment: in general "exp protcol" is French; "exp design" is English. Though "protocol" also exists it is far less used -->
<!-- For the two sentences below (This approach ... of theories), I'd try something more explicit. Something like "In this chapter we adopt the approach commonly followed in most of the literature in behavioral and experimental economics: testing the behavioral predictions of a model, with the aim of documenting the existence of a specific behaviour and its characteristics, thus guiding the developmen of theories". Maybe too long and convoluted, but I think it "leads" by hand the reader more. Then, as usual, up to you. -->
This approach that tests the behavioral predictions of the models is the common 
approach in the literature. 
This approach allows to document the specificities of individual behaviors 
and thus guide the development of theories. 
But identifying behaviors consistent with a theory does not test its validity. 
As pointed out by Karl Popper in @popper2005logic a given behavior can be 
predicted by a large number of different models. Moreover, there is an
asymmetry between confirmation and refutation of a theory: no matter how many 
observations in favor of a theory we have, it only takes one 
observation to invalidate it. 
<!-- in general, Popper is way too harsh, as ONE obs usually does NOT validate a theory, and rightly so. It is rather extreme to cite Popper, phil of science has moved on to more nuanced takes, but it's fine here, and then you nuance yourself further down. Just wanted to tell you though, as this might come up in the defense / discussion :-) -->
This must however be relativized by the imprecision and the possible errors of 
observations. 
But this idea encouraged me to adopt a different approach from the standard 
approach in experimental economics in the second half of my thesis. 
The idea is to construct the experimental design in such a way as to 
repeatedly observe a situation in which we know the theoretically expected 
behavior. 
We then compare the observed behavior to the behavior predicted by one or more 
theories. 
This approach, even if it does not allow us to falsify a theory in the sense of 
Popper, allows us to compare different models. <!-- and do what exactly with the results? filter out bad theories? concentrate on the good ones? is goodness of fit the metric we'd like to have / prefer? -->

By applying this approach and comparing economic models to simple statistical 
models I have shown in this thesis that the temptation model proposed by 
@gul2001temptation predicts behaviors that are actually observed in our 
experience. <!-- so here you say it predicts; then in sentence 2 that it does better than EUT; and in sentcence 3 that it does worse than stupid model; and in sentence 4 yous tart with "this lack of validity"... I understand that you do this to build up your argument, but "lack of" means "NONE OF IT" and you startedin sentence 1 with "it does predict". 
I suggest 1. to tone down the first sentence, possibly with "it does predict up to a point" or "partially predicts" or similar; and 2. toen down the last sentence also, as there is no "lack f predictive validity" but rather "low and disappointing" predictive validity. The 4 sentence are fine, and the argument too, but it would be stronger if it were more nuanced; too bold a claim is just not believed and hence weaker. And you have to make claims you can support. -->
This model represents a more accurate description of subjects' choices for menus 
than the standard expected utility model. 
But @gul2001temptation's model does not describe behaviors more accurately than 
a model that ignores the composition of a menu. 
This lack of descriptive and predictive ability is also found with the 
expectation utility model for lottery choices. 
It has been shown that individual choices in the area of risk preferences are 
highly variable. 
We have also shown that even if the expected utility models and the 
@gul2001temptation model do not correctly account for the choices of the 
subjects, it is possible to propose models that better describe the individual 
choices than the constant response models that perform as well as our economic models. 
<!-- equalize = "Ã©galiser" like in the score of a match/game. "perform" is better. -->

To conclude, I would like to propose an interesting way to improve risk 
preference models. 
<!-- "interesting" means "basically useless". Just don't use it. Find another adjective of use none. If it is interesting, it should appear from your description of it. -->
The idea comes from the foreword @aliprantis2006hitchhiker: 
"*It has become clear in the last couple of decades that economic 
models capable of addressing real policy questions must be both stochastic
and dynamic. There are fundamental aspects of the economy that static models
cannot capture. Deterministic models, even chaotically deterministic models,
seem unable to explain our observations of the world*".
I think that looking for models that allow individual choices to be both dynamic 
and random could improve the predictive and descriptive capacity of models in 
economics.
<!-- Yeah well but these models DO exist in econ. They are not widespreadly cited / used yet, but they DO exist. 
For instance you get, in a completely different area, the DSGE class of models - Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium models, that you know, theri very name does what you want. And there are dynamic, stochastic models of choice around. You and I are not fluent in them, does not mean they do not exist. So maybe say that *in the specific domain of risk/temptation* as a result of your work you urge people to consider developing dynamic/stochastic extensions of the models used, as your work clearly shows that what we have in store right now performs poorly on data when compared to dummy, stupid models. And that it's time to move to other stuff, and adopt best practices used elsewhere. Which is what you do in a sense, but being more explicit about the fact that you are not advocating a revolution on a blank sheet of pper but an evolution in a direction that is already fruitfully exploited elewhere would be better IMHO.-->
