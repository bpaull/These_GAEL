# Conclusion {-#conclusion5}

This thesis has been for me the opportunity to shape my understanding of 
economic research; 
in particular the impact of different approaches to experiments in economics. 
When I started my thesis, I was focused on developing experimental protocols 
that would allow me to measure subjects' preferences as accurately as possible. 
To design these protocols I relied heavily on theoretical work concerning the 
models I wanted to test. 
My goal was to place my subjects in a situation as close as possible to the 
theoretical model while exploring as much as possible the impact of the 
different parameters of the model on individual preferences. 
<!-- The sentence below is still unclear -- better than the last iteration, but still a bit circular and not very clear. 
What do you want to say? that chapt2 suffers because it is over-reliant on econ theory. Then say so explicitly. 
Else it is "bad because approach, and approach bad" and it is not really informative. Which approach? Why does it limit the robustness? to the cost of being a bit repetitive, it is better to be precise and clearly convey the message. -->
The experiment presented in chapter 2 is an example of this approach and it 
suffers from this approach which limits the robustness of the analysis of the 
data in this chapter. 
My collaboration with Rustam Romaniuc, Dimitri Dubois and Paolo Crosetto 
encouraged me to develop an experimental design for the temptation model of 
@gul2001temptation but which aimed at highlighting the demand for commitment and
the capacity of individuals to exercise self-control. 
<!-- For the two sentences below (This approach ... of theories), I'd try something more explicit. Something like "In this chapter we adopt the approach commonly followed in most of the literature in behavioral and experimental economics: testing the behavioral predictions of a model, with the aim of documenting the existence of a specific behaviour and its characteristics, thus guiding the developmen of theories". Maybe too long and convoluted, but I think it "leads" by hand the reader more. Then, as usual, up to you. -->
This approach that tests the behavioral predictions of the models is the common 
approach in the literature. 
This approach allows to document the specificities of individual behaviors 
and thus guide the development of theories. 
But identifying behaviors consistent with a theory does not test its validity. 
As pointed out by Karl Popper in @popper2005logic a given behavior can be 
predicted by a large number of different models. Moreover, there is an
asymmetry between confirmation and refutation of a theory: no matter how many 
observations in favor of a theory we have, it only takes one 
observation to invalidate it. 
This must however be relativized by the imprecision and the possible errors of 
observations. 
But this idea encouraged me to adopt a different approach from the standard 
approach in experimental economics in the second half of my thesis. 
The idea is to construct the experimental design in such a way as to 
repeatedly observe a situation in which we know the theoretically expected 
behavior. 
We then compare the observed behavior to the behavior predicted by one or more 
theories. 
This approach, even if it does not allow us to falsify a theory in the sense of 
Karl Popper, allows us to compare different models. 
By applying this approach and comparing economic models to simple statistical 
models I have shown in this thesis that the temptation model proposed by 
@gul2001temptation predicts behaviors that are actually observed in our 
experience. 
This model represents a more accurate description of subjects' choices for menus 
than the standard expected utility model. 
But @gul2001temptation's model does not describe behaviors more accurately than 
a model that ignores the composition of a menu. 
This lack of descriptive and predictive ability is also found with the 
expectation utility model for lottery choices. 
It has been shown that individual choices in the area of risk preferences are 
highly variable. 
We have also shown that even if the expected utility models and the 
@gul2001temptation model do not correctly account for the choices of the 
subjects, it is possible to propose models that better describe the individual 
choices than the constant response models that perform as well as our economic models.

To conclude, I would like to propose a way to improve risk 
preference models. 
The idea comes from the foreword @aliprantis2006hitchhiker: 
"*It has become clear in the last couple of decades that economic 
models capable of addressing real policy questions must be both stochastic
and dynamic. There are fundamental aspects of the economy that static models
cannot capture. Deterministic models, even chaotically deterministic models,
seem unable to explain our observations of the world*".
I think that looking for models in decsion theory that allow individual choices 
to be both dynamic 
and random could improve the predictive and descriptive capacity of models in 
economics.
