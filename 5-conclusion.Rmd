# Conclusion

This thesis has been for me the opportunity to shape my understanding of 
economic research; 
in particular the impact of different approaches to experiments in economics. 
When I started my thesis, I was focused on developing experimental protocols 
that would allow me to measure subjects' preferences as accurately as possible. 
To design these protocols I relied heavily on theoretical work concerning the 
models I wanted to test. 
My goal was to place my subjects in a situation as close as possible to the 
theoretical model while exploring as much as possible the impact of the 
different parameters of the model on individual preferences. 
The experiment presented in chapter 2 is an example of this approach and it 
suffers from this approach which limits the robustness of the analysis of the 
data in this chapter. 
My collaboration with Rustam Romaniuc, Dimitri Dubois and Paolo Crosetto 
encouraged me to develop an experimental protocol for the temptation model of 
@gul2001temptation but which aimed at highlighting the demand for commitment and
the capacity of individuals to exercise self-control. 
This approach that tests the behavioral predictions of the models is the common 
approach in the literature. 
This approach allows us to document the specificities of individual behaviors 
and thus guide the development of theories.
