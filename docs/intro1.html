<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In this thesis, we try to provide elements to test temptation models in the
laboratory.
By temptation model we mean here the model proposed in <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-gul2001temptation" role="doc-biblioref">Gul and Pesendorfer</a> (<a href="#ref-gul2001temptation" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span> and
the models inspired by it, like <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-noor2010uphill" role="doc-biblioref">Noor and Takeoka</a> (<a href="#ref-noor2010uphill" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span> or <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-noor2015menu" role="doc-biblioref">Noor and Takeoka</a> (<a href="#ref-noor2015menu" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Specifically, we are interested in models with the following two characteristics:
They model preferences for menus, that is, preferences for sets of choices in
which only one alternative can be chosen.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>
This approach was initiated by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-kreps1979representation" role="doc-biblioref">Kreps</a> (<a href="#ref-kreps1979representation" role="doc-biblioref">1979</a>)</span>.
And this models must allow preference for the restrictions, that is to say that
an individual can prefer a menu to a menu which is his super set
(i.e to prefer a menu containing less elements).</p>
<p>We are interested in this model because it allows us to rationalize behavior
that cannot be rationalized within the expected utility theory.
For example, the demand for a costly commitment <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bryan2010commitment" role="doc-biblioref">Bryan, Karlan, and Nelson 2010</a>; <a href="#ref-ashraf2006tying" role="doc-biblioref">Ashraf, Karlan, and Yin 2006</a>)</span>, the exercise of self-control <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-dellavigna2004contract" role="doc-biblioref">DellaVigna and Malmendier 2004</a>)</span> or the choice of subscriptions inconsistent with the use of a service <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-dellavigna2006paying" role="doc-biblioref">DellaVigna and Malmendier 2006</a>)</span>.
We chose to focus on the temptation model from an experimental point of view
because the theoretical literature already proposes a large number of models
(the reader who wants to be convinced can consult the literature review on the subject <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-lipman2013temptation" role="doc-biblioref">Lipman, Pesendorfer, and others</a> (<a href="#ref-lipman2013temptation" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>), but the experimental literature on the subject does not propose a design allowing to compare these models;
Both in terms of their descriptive and predictive performance and in terms of their accuracy in describing behavioral frequencies such as the exercise of self-control or the willingness to pay for a commitment.
The experimental literature on temptation is focused on the demonstration of existence of
behavior predicted by theoretical models of temptation and in contradiction with
the expected utility model.
To mention only a few of these works, the exercise of self-control and the costs
it induces first by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-mischel1989delay" role="doc-biblioref">Mischel, Shoda, and Rodriguez</a> (<a href="#ref-mischel1989delay" role="doc-biblioref">1989</a>)</span> and then in <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-kuhn2014self" role="doc-biblioref">Kuhn, Kuhn, and Villeval</a> (<a href="#ref-kuhn2014self" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>, the preference for a
restricted set of choices in <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-toussaert2018eliciting" role="doc-biblioref">Toussaert</a> (<a href="#ref-toussaert2018eliciting" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> and the demand for an expensive
commitment in <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-houser2018temptation" role="doc-biblioref">Houser et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-houser2018temptation" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>.
This leaves room for an experimental design that would allow us to measure the
effects of temptation on preferences and thus differentiate the different
temptation models.</p>
<p>This thesis is composed of three chapters, each describing an online experiment.
The first two experiments aim at testing temptation models.
The first experiment focuses on a behavioral aspect through the effect of commitment on risk taking.
The second one tests the descriptive capacity of temptation models by eliciting
preferences for menus.
The last one does not test temptation but the stability of preferences for money.
The latter highlights that the instability of individual preferences has
important consequences on the tools used in experimental economics to test a
theory and on the reliability of the preferences elicited.</p>
<p>The original title of this thesis was “Temptation and strategic interaction:
theory and experiment.”
The objective was to propose an extension to the existing temptation models,
notably those of <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-gul2001temptation" role="doc-biblioref">Gul and Pesendorfer</a> (<a href="#ref-gul2001temptation" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span> and <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-fudenberg2006dual" role="doc-biblioref">Fudenberg and Levine</a> (<a href="#ref-fudenberg2006dual" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>, to take into account the combined effects of temptation and strategic interactions.
The original PhD thesis project was based on work carried out for my master thesis.
My master thesis consisted in a model that extended the <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-fudenberg2006dual" role="doc-biblioref">Fudenberg and Levine</a> (<a href="#ref-fudenberg2006dual" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span> individual-choice model to two individuals, each composed of two selves and having to decide on the distribution of a budget when their choices
are strategic substitutes.
The model developed for the master thesis highlighted that when actions are strategic substitutes, the
individual with the lowest self-control costs must compensate for the lack of
self-control of the other individual.</p>
<p>My first original work within the scope of this original plan was to propose an experiment to test the
behavioral predictions of the model developed in my master’s thesis.
For that I realized a small experiment (40 subjects) built on the experimental design used by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-houser2018temptation" role="doc-biblioref">Houser et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-houser2018temptation" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>.
In this first experiment we tested the self-control capacity of the subjects by asking
them to perform a boring, paid task (looking at a screen displaying the current time) and giving them the possibility to switch to a more interesting, but unpaid task (surfing the
internet).
The subjects were also given the opportunity to costly commit: they could give up a small part of their earnings to continue the boring task without being offered the choice of switching task.
My experimental design consisted of two parts.
The first part was a replication of the <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-houser2018temptation" role="doc-biblioref">Houser et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-houser2018temptation" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> experiment and aimed at estimating the individual self-control capacity of the subjects.
The second part aimed at testing their self-control capacity in a context with strategic interactions.
For this purpose, the remuneration of the daunting task was modified to place
pairs of subjects in a situation where their choices are strategic substitute.
The – ex-ante unexpected – results of this experiment are that all of our
subjects chose to keep performing the
boring task for the whole 2 hours that experiment lasted.
This did not replicate the results of <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-houser2018temptation" role="doc-biblioref">Houser et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-houser2018temptation" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> who found that only
28.7% of the subjects keep performing the tasks without paying to avoid
temptations and, did not allow us to test the influence of strategic
interactions.
The differences in results with <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-houser2018temptation" role="doc-biblioref">Houser et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-houser2018temptation" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> can be explained by the
differences in dates between the 2 experiments, the original experiment having
taken place in the early 2010s and mine in late 2018.
The relationship to the internet has strongly evolved between these two dates
(think of the actual use of smartphones for example)
and makes an activity like surfing the internet in a lab much less attractive.
This first experiment taught me two lessons that were then applied in the
remainder of the thesis.
First, the choice of the
tempting alternative is difficult because its tempting nature can vary between
individuals but also over time.
making direct replications of past successful design far from trivial.
Second, to test the impact of strategic interactions it would be easier to have
an experimental protocol that does not rely on binary choices but allows for
greater variability in individual behavior.</p>
<p>I therefore started to work on an experimental design, which would give rise to
<a href="tempting-lab.html#tempting-lab">chapter 2</a>,</p>
<p>that would allow the measure the effect of temptation at the
individual level and which does not depend on the a priori level of temptation generated by an
alternative but which allows us to identify which are the alternatives that the
subject considers tempting.
In order to do this, I chose to construct the experimental design in such a way
as to be as close as possible to the theoretical framework proposed by
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-gul2001temptation" role="doc-biblioref">Gul and Pesendorfer</a> (<a href="#ref-gul2001temptation" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span>.
This allowed me to directly elicit individual preferences for menus, and to build the
menus in such a way as that they induce different level of the temptation
according to different theories.</p>
<p>In parallel to the preparation of this protocol, Rustam Romaniuc (Montpellier Business School) and Dimitri
Dubois (INRAE Montpellier) offered me through Paolo Crosetto the opportunity to propose a treatment
concerning temptation in their experimental project on risk.
Their project planned to measure risk preferences repeatedly before and after an
intervention.
I proposed to test the impact of a freely chosen limit on the maximum level of
risk a player could take.
The intervention consisted in proposing to the subjects to limit the level of
risk they could take in the second half of the experiment and to let them choose
this level.
But with the particularity that this limit would only be applied to a quarter of
the people who would ask for it.
This allows us to observe the limit that subjects desire as well as their
behavior when this limit is not applied.
This allows us to relate the level of the requested limit to the capacity for
self-limitation, from our point of view the link between demand for commitment
and capacity for self-control.
This treatment also allows us to compare the impact of the limit when it is
binding or not.</p>
<p>While analyzing the data from this experiment I noticed an unexpected
difficulty.
I had five observations of risk preferences for each of my subjects before and
five after the treatment, but these five observations seemed to be extremely variable.
This variability between the individual observations was also found in the
observations of the subjects of our control group, who was not exposed to any treatment.
However, if there are many experiments which inform us about the average level
of preference for the subject (for example the <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-lejuez2002evaluation" role="doc-biblioref">Lejuez et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-lejuez2002evaluation" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a>)</span> or
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-crosetto2013bomb" role="doc-biblioref">Crosetto and Filippin</a> (<a href="#ref-crosetto2013bomb" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> to quote only the ones which inspired chapter 3), there is to
our knowledge no article concerning the whitin-subject individual variability of the
measurement of preferences for risk.
There exists works, like <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-ert2017revisiting" role="doc-biblioref">Ert and Haruvy</a> (<a href="#ref-ert2017revisiting" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>, that take multiple measures of risk
but don’t
compute variability; and works like <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-wilcox2007predicting" role="doc-biblioref">Wilcox</a> (<a href="#ref-wilcox2007predicting" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span> that compute estimation
error across repetitions; but no one, to the best of my knowledge, has directly computed individual variability.
Individual variability is necessary to judge the quality of the estimates, as
well as to use simulations to calibrate the experiments and to judge the
reliability of the experimental results.
I have therefore realized an experiment to test the variability of risk
preferences which is described in the <a href="multi-choice.html#multi-choice">chapter 3</a> of this thesis.
This experiment shows that the variability of individual preferences is
large and must be taken into account in the analysis of experimental
results in the domain of risk attitudes, on the one hand by having as often as possible a
difference-in-difference analysis as other analyses cause an
underestimation of the Type-I risk
, and on the other hand by
recurring as little as possible to individual level estimations.
In order to take into account the results of chapter 3 I opted for a
difference-in-difference analysis for chapter 1 using a Bayesian rather
than a frequentist approach for the estimates to account for individual
variability.
For chapter 2 I chose to modify the analysis to test the validity of the
temptation models against statistical models in order to have a reference point.</p>
<p>As during these three years of thesis my work deviated from the initial subject,
I chose to rename my thesis <em>Two Different Experimental Approches For Testing
Temptation And A Test Of Stability Of Individual Risk Preferences</em>.
Indeed, the central point of this thesis is to explore experimental methods to
test temptation.
The last two chapters are attempts to answer technical problems on the subject.
Therefore the approach chosen throughout the thesis is somewhat different from
the usual approach in experimental economics.
I have chosen to use methods inspired by statistics and machine learning;
notably the use as much as possible of training and test samples to control for
overlearning of the models, the use of bootstrap sampling to compare results
over a large number of samples and smooth the results, and comparisons of the
results of our models with reference models in terms of metrics such as Mean
Square Error (MSE).
The use of these methods aimed at focusing our analysis on errors due to our
observation methods, as well as those of the subjects and model errors that are
rarely taken into account in economics as highlighted in <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-taleb2005fooled" role="doc-biblioref">Taleb</a> (<a href="#ref-taleb2005fooled" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>.
This error-centered approach has two objectives, on the one hand to test the
reliability of the models we are studying and the contribution of the
experimental protocols proposed through this thesis.
On the other hand, it allows us to approach the models we study with a
refutation objective inspired by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-popper2005logic" role="doc-biblioref">Popper</a> (<a href="#ref-popper2005logic" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span> and <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-popper2014conjectures" role="doc-biblioref">Popper</a> (<a href="#ref-popper2014conjectures" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>.
We compare here the models with dummy models and we show that these dummy models
are better descriptors of individual behaviors.
Of course this method is far from allowing a formal refutation of the models, but it is the
closest method to refutation that I could propose.
The disadvantage of this approach is that it implies focusing on models chosen
specifically in advance and constructing the experiment in such a way as to have
a training set as well as a test set for the model.
The approach chosen as well as the initial objective of answering a technical
problem such as measuring temptation places me in a situation where the links
with the existing literature are limited. This is particularly true with regard to chapter
three, which deals with a question that to best of my knowledge has not been directly studied.</p>
<p>Even if this thesis raises more problems than it answers, I think it brings the
following elements:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The first chapter provides new information on the differences between hard
and soft commitment.
It allows to put forward a form of complementarity between these two forms of
commitment.
This chapter also highlights the way in which subjects choose to use their
self-control by allowing themselves to exceed their limit at times but by
reducing their risk-taking below this limit at other times.</li>
<li>The second chapter shows that taking into account the effect of temptation
marginally improves the standard model but that these models are not better
descriptors of subjects’ choices on menus than a constant choice model.</li>
<li>The third chapter highlights that individual choices in the risk domain are
very variable to such an extent that it does not seem to be pssible to correctly describe them
using a distribution with a central moment.
This puts into question both the expected utility model and most random models
such as <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-gul2006random" role="doc-biblioref">Gul and Pesendorfer</a> (<a href="#ref-gul2006random" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>, <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-ratcliff2008diffusion" role="doc-biblioref">Ratcliff and McKoon</a> (<a href="#ref-ratcliff2008diffusion" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span> or <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-cerreia2019deliberately" role="doc-biblioref">Cerreia-Vioglio et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-cerreia2019deliberately" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>.
This chapter also highlights a ghost treatment effect, finding significant
differences between similar groups.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, while this thesis does not propose an experimental protocol for
measuring temptation, it does highlight problems in temptation models as well as
in the expected utility model that invite us to further explore the variability
of individual preferences.</p>
