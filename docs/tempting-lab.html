<div id="intro3" class="section level2" number="3.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>In this chapter we present an experiment which aims to test the descriptive
capacity of the model proposed by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-gul2001temptation" role="doc-biblioref">Gul and Pesendorfer</a> (<a href="#ref-gul2001temptation" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span> (hereafter G-P).
The predictions of this model are compared with those of different economic
models and with simple statistical models.
To evaluate the descriptive capacity of the models, our experiment places
subjects in a situation as close as possible to the theoretical framework of
G-P.
Subjects are asked to choose by means of an incentivized elicitation mechanism
among menus composed by lotteries.
A menu here is a set of 1 to 6 lotteries, from which the subject knows that she will have to
choose only one lottery in the end.
Our approach differs from that of the previous chapter and from experiments such
as those of <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-houser2018temptation" role="doc-biblioref">Houser et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-houser2018temptation" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> or <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-toussaert2018eliciting" role="doc-biblioref">Toussaert</a> (<a href="#ref-toussaert2018eliciting" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> on the subject.
Our experiment does not aim at showing the existence of a particular behavior
predicted by the theory such as the demand for commitment or the capacity of the
subjects to exercise their self-control.
It aims instead to evaluate the
ability of G-P to describe the actual behavior of the subjects,
and to compare its performance to various alternatives, ranging from economic to
statistical models.</p>
<p>This experiment does not question the existence of behavior at odds with expected utility theory,
such as the demand for constraints (<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-chow2011demand" role="doc-biblioref">Chow and Acland</a> (<a href="#ref-chow2011demand" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>, <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-gine2010put" role="doc-biblioref">Giné, Karlan, and Zinman</a> (<a href="#ref-gine2010put" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span> and <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-uhl2011self" role="doc-biblioref">Uhl and others</a> (<a href="#ref-uhl2011self" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>),<br />
self-control effects (<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-burger2011field" role="doc-biblioref">Burger, Charness, and Lynham</a> (<a href="#ref-burger2011field" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>, <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-mischel1989delay" role="doc-biblioref">Mischel, Shoda, and Rodriguez</a> (<a href="#ref-mischel1989delay" role="doc-biblioref">1989</a>)</span> and
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-kuhn2014self" role="doc-biblioref">Kuhn, Kuhn, and Villeval</a> (<a href="#ref-kuhn2014self" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>) or more surprising attitude like in
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-dellavigna2006paying" role="doc-biblioref">DellaVigna and Malmendier</a> (<a href="#ref-dellavigna2006paying" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>.
These behaviors are well established in the experimental literature.
Our experiment questions the menu preference approach as a way to rationalize
these behaviors.
This approach, initiated by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-kreps1979representation" role="doc-biblioref">Kreps</a> (<a href="#ref-kreps1979representation" role="doc-biblioref">1979</a>)</span>, aims at rationalizing the
preference that individuals may have for larger sets of choices.
The idea being that an individual who is uncertain about his future preferences
would prefer to have a larger number of options to choose from when making his
decision in order to maximize his utility.
Later G-P proposed a model in which individuals may be averse to the<br />
presence of certain options and therefore prefer smaller choice sets.
G-P’s model rationalizes the demand for constraints by subjects while allowing
for the possibility of costly self-constraint.
The G-P model was later extended to rationalize more behaviors.
For example <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-gul2004self" role="doc-biblioref">Gul and Pesendorfer</a> (<a href="#ref-gul2004self" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span> for repeated choices , <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-noor2010uphill" role="doc-biblioref">Noor and Takeoka</a> (<a href="#ref-noor2010uphill" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span> for anticipated
temptation cost or <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-noor2015menu" role="doc-biblioref">Noor and Takeoka</a> (<a href="#ref-noor2015menu" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> for more complex interactions among elements of
a menu – for a review of application and extensions of the original G-P model see the review by
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-lipman2013temptation" role="doc-biblioref">Lipman, Pesendorfer, and others</a> (<a href="#ref-lipman2013temptation" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Our experience shows that in terms of descriptive power the G-P model is a
slight improvement over EUT.
But the G-P model does not do better than a model where subjects all evaluate
their menus in the same way and independently of their composition.
Moreover, a simple regression model outperforms the G-P model.</p>
<p>The goal of our design is to be as close as possible to the theoretical
framework formulated by G-P. We have therefore focused on the ellicitation of
the menu value.
Therefore we do not have a mechanism that would allow us to identify the
different states of the world that are at the basis of the temptation models
proposed by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-dekel2001representing" role="doc-biblioref">Dekel, Lipman, and Rustichini</a> (<a href="#ref-dekel2001representing" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span>, <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-dekel2007representing" role="doc-biblioref">Dekel et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-dekel2007representing" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span> or
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-dekel2009temptation" role="doc-biblioref">Dekel, Lipman, and Rustichini</a> (<a href="#ref-dekel2009temptation" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>.
Nor can we identify the choices of different selves as in the multiple-self
models proposed by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-fudenberg2006dual" role="doc-biblioref">Fudenberg and Levine</a> (<a href="#ref-fudenberg2006dual" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>.
Therefore, we will not propose any interpretation of our data in the framework
of these models.</p>
<p>Our approach will allow us to propose a method allowing us to elicit the two
functions used in the G-P model for each of our subjects.
G-P shows that an individual whose preferences are complete, transitive,
continuous, independent and satisfying the axiom of <em>Set Betweenness</em>:
<span class="math display">\[
A \succsim B \text{ implies } A \succsim A\cup B \succsim B
\]</span>
has a utility function for menus of the form:
<span class="math display">\[
U(A) = max_{x \in A}(u(x) + v(x)) - max_{y \in A}(v(y))
\]</span>
With <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> was menus and <span class="math inline">\(u(.)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v(.)\)</span> was Von-Neumann Morgenstren
utility functions.
What we will do in our analysis is to estimate for each menu the value
associated for the function <span class="math inline">\(u(.)\)</span> and for the function <span class="math inline">\(v(.)\)</span> and to compare
the theoretical value of the resulting menu to the one indicated by the subject.
We do not test the validity of the axioms but that of their theoretical
consequence.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Experimental design</h3>
<p>Our experience took place from 12/06/2020 to 19/08/2020.
It took place online and the recruitment of the subjects was done via the Amazon
Mechanical Turk (AMT) platform.
On the AMT platform a job offer was published indicating the approximate
duration and the fixed payment as well as an average bonus higher than 5$.
From this offer, subjects could accept to participate in our experiment by
accepting the task on AMT.
No selection criteria are applied a priori to the subjects. But only the subjects having filled in a valid end-of-experience code were included in the analysis. Conditions of minimum duration of working time and number of trials are also applied but do not exclude any subject.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The software itself is developed using the R language and the Shiny framework.
Once the experiment is completed, the experimental software displays a summary
of the subjects’ bonus and a unique code to be filled in the corresponding field
on the AMT platform.
This code allows us to uniquely identify the subjects’ responses between our
software and the AMT platform.
The target number of subjects was 300.
304 subjects filled in a response code on the AMT page but this code was only
valid for 297 of them.
The 7 subjects whose code was not valid were excluded from the dataset and were
not paid.</p>
<p>The experience proceeds
as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The subject faces a screen with instructions.
This screen describes the next steps in the experiment and details how the
subject will earn his payoff.
The subject is given a description of the menu and how the lottery works.
Particular emphasis is put on the impact on the bonus of the mechanism of choice
of a menu.
Instructions are provided in <a href="expe-instruc3.html#expe-instruc3">Appendix B</a>.</li>
<li>The subject has to answer a short series of multiple-choice control questions.
To continue, the subject must answer all questions correctly.
To do so, he has as many attempts as he wants and a help is displayed for the
questions to which the answer is wrong at the first attempt.</li>
<li>Start of incentivized learning phase:</li>
<li>The subject has to bid on 10 pairs of menus by indicating with a slider the
maximum amount he is willing to pay between -1$ and 1$ (the bidding mechanism
is described in detail in the following section).
The menus on which the subject bids are built in the same way as those of the
rest of the experiment but the values used for the lotteries that compose them
are different.</li>
<li>One of the bids that has just been made is drawn and the subject chooses one
of the lotteries that it contains.</li>
<li>A screen indicates to the subject what amount he has won with the steps 4 and
5, either the amount resulting from the selected auction and the amount
corresponding to the resolution of the chosen lottery.</li>
<li>The subject is asked to complete a second quiz similar to the one in step 2
but with different questions.</li>
<li>Main taks: the subject bids on 35 comparisons between 2 menus.</li>
<li>5 of these comparisons are drawn at random and the subject can choose 1
lottery from each of the 5 menus assigned to him according to her bid and the elicitation mechanism.</li>
<li>The lotteries are solved and the subject’s bonus is calculated as the total
won on the 5 bids on the selected comparisons and the results of the 5 chosen
lotteries plus what was already won in the learning phase.</li>
<li>On the final page, a table summarizes the subject’s winnings by selected
comparisons indicating the amount won via the auction and the lottery results.
The total of the 6 auctions and lotteries is also displayed along with a
reminder that the subject must fill in the code displayed on this page on AMT.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our experiment is composed of only one treatment.
The earnings of the subjects are paid via the AMT platform.
They are composed of a fixed part of 1$ paid to all the subjects who filled in
a valid code in the AMT form, and a variable part calculated according to the bids on the 6 selected
comparisons and the resolution of the 6 lotteries they chose (1 in the learning
and 5 in the main phase).</p>
<p>Our subjects were thus paid an average of 6.97$ for
an average time of 41 seconds spent on our experiment.
So an average wage per hour of
10.3$</p>
<p>The objective of our experimental protocol is to elicit the value that subjects
place on menus.
A menu is a set of items from which the subject must choose 1 and only 1 item.
To be as close as possible to the theoretical model of G-P we chose to build our
menus with lotteries.
In order to keep our experiment as simple as possible we chose to use binary
lotteries similar to the bets that can be made in roulette games in casinos.
That is to say lotteries allowing to win <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>$ with a probability of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{n}\)</span>
and 0$ otherwise.
The menus can be composed of 1 to 6 lotteries with the possible values of <span class="math inline">\(n \in [2, 4, 6, 8, 16, 32]\)</span>.
All lotteries have the same expected value of 1, and differ in variance only, that is increasing in <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. This keeps the individual elements of the menus as simple and intuitive as possible.</p>
<p>To elicit the value of the menus we have chosen to use a variant of the BDM auction
method proposed by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-becker1964measuring" role="doc-biblioref">Becker, DeGroot, and Marschak</a> (<a href="#ref-becker1964measuring" role="doc-biblioref">1964</a>)</span>.
This auction method consists in asking the subjects the maximum amount they
would be willing to pay to acquire a good, then to randomly choose a number;
if the number drawn is lower than the value announced by the subject then the
subject must buy the good for the amount drawn.
This method encourages the subject to reveal the true maximum amount he is willing to
pay for a good.
Indeed, a subject who does not indicate his true value runs the risk of paying
more for a good than he is willing to pay or risks not acquiring the good for an
amount lower than what he would have been willing to pay.
The method we use differs from the one presented in <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-becker1964measuring" role="doc-biblioref">Becker, DeGroot, and Marschak</a> (<a href="#ref-becker1964measuring" role="doc-biblioref">1964</a>)</span> because
we want to compare menus between them.
So we ask subject for the maximum amount he is willing to pay to <em>exchange</em> one
menu for another (we will call this amount willingness-to-change, WTC).
So to elicit the WTC between 2 menus we present to subjects the one menu on
the left of the screen and the other on the right, the subject has to indicate an amount
between -$1 and $1 corresponding to the maximum amount he is ready to pay to
exchange the menu on the left against the one on the right.
If the randomly chosen number is less than the value indicated by the subject,
the subject receives the right menu and must pay an amount equal to the number
drawn (paying a negative amount means receiving money).
If the number drawn at random is strictly higher than the amount indicated by
the subject, the subject receives the left menu.</p>
<p>In our experiment, subjects indicate the maximum amount they are willing to pay
using a slider located between the 2 menus.
In order not to induce an anchoring effect, the initial position of the slider
is determined randomly for each comparison.
This allows us to see that in 85.39% of the
cases the subjects have effectively indicated their preference by moving the
slider from the place where it was initially placed.</p>
<p>As with 6 different items it is possible to build 63 different menus and
therefore 1953 different 2-by-2 comparisons, we restricted the comparisons made
by the subjects to the one that seemed the most interesting for us<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>.
The 35 comparisons that we have retained for each subject are the following:</p>
<p>These comparisons were chosen to allow reliable estimates of preferences with many
observations of comparison of size 1 menus with each other and with size 2

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.2</span> Estimations and Models</h3>
<p>In order to implement the economic models on our data, it is necessary to
estimate the preferences of the subjects. In the following sections we present
the methods we have chosen.
In order to estimate individual preferences on singletons, we use the following
methodology:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We consider a menu comparison set of size 1.
For each comparison we construct 2 equations.
For example, if we consider the comparison between a menu A and a menu B we
construct the 2 equations:
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(A = B + x\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(B = A - x\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>We assign a value of 0 to one of the menus.</li>
<li>We solve each equation for which the right-hand side can be calculated.</li>
<li>Each singleton is assigned the average value of the equations for which it is
the left-hand member that could be calculated.</li>
<li>Repeat step 3 until the desired number of iterations is reached.</li>
<li>Each singleton is assigned the average value of the last n iterations (or n
an arbitrary number).</li>
<li>We normalize the values by subtracting the value of one of the singletons.</li>
</ol>
<p>We tested this methodology on our data and the procedure seem to converges
quickly after about 30 iterations the variation in the estimated value is
negligible.
And the result is independent of the singleton chosen as starting point.</p>
<p>This methodology allows us to estimate the preferences for the singletons while
taking into account the variability in the subjects’ responses.
However, this method is based on 2 assumptions.
The first one is that there is indeed a preference value for the singletons to
be estimated and the second one is that the comparison of elements is
symmetrical.
We do not test either of these two hypotheses in our experiment but consider
them as valid or at least as reasonable approximations.</p>
<p>To estimate the effect of temptation, we use a procedure similar to the one used
to estimate preferences for singletons.
The only difference is the way we build the equations from a comparison between
2 menus.
As an example, we focus here on comparisons between menus of size 2 and size 1.
We use the estimates made on the singletons to identify the preferred item in
each menu of size 2, once this item is identified we compute a theoretical
difference with the menu of size 1 by subtracting the estimated value of the
preferred item of the menu of size 2 from the one of size 1.
We calculate the corrected comparison of preferences that we use to build our 2
equations.
For example let’s consider the comparison between the menus <span class="math inline">\(A = \{a_1, a_2\}\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(B = \{b\}\)</span>, and suppose that the estimates of the preferences for the singletons yield <span class="math inline">\(hat{u}(\{a_1\}) &gt; \hat{u}(\{a_2\})\)</span>.
We note <span class="math inline">\(wtc_t = \hat{u}(\{a_1\}) - \hat{u}(\{b\})\)</span>.
We construct the 2 equations:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(A = B + x - wtc_t\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(B = A - x + wtc_t\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>With these equations we use the same procedure as for the estimation of
singletons.
The preferences estimated in this way allow us to calculate the value predicted
by the expected utility model for each of our 35 menus.</p>
<p>In our analysis we will compare the results of 5 different models.
These models are grouped in two categories, the statistical models which are the
application of statistical methods to our data and the economic models which are
implementations of economic theories adapted to our data.
The two statistical models are the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Constant response model.
This model consists in calculating for each individual the aggregate average WTC he is
willing to pay, over all comparisons between menus of size one and between menus
of sizes two and one.
This model predicts that the WTC of an individual for any pair of menu items is
his average aggregate WTC.
This model is dummy but it is useful as a lower-bar reference point. It seems reasonable to assume that a relevant model is more efficient than this constant response model.
Using this kind of dummy model as a comparison point is a common practice in
machine learning.</p></li>
<li><p>Linear regression.
This model consists in estimate a linear regression model for each individual.
The explained variable of this regression is the WTC between 2 menus and the
explanatory variables are variables indicating the presence of the elements in
the compared menus.
This type of model is the usual starting point in machine learning, it is
relatively simple, not expensive in terms of calculation and can easily predict
new values if we have the corresponding explanatory variables, which is our
case.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The economic models that we have chosen are the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The expected utility model (EUT).
This is the model that corresponds to the <em>standard theory</em> in economics where
the value of a menu depends only on the value of the item inside it that will be
chosen, therefore on the preferred item that it contains.
We have chosen to call it the expected utility model because our menus contain
lotteries.
The WTC between two menus is calculated as the difference between the preferred
items that each menu contains.
We have to estimate for each individual the relative value of each item
contained in the menus.</p></li>
<li><p>The Gul and Pesendorfer model (G-P).
In this model, we estimate the value of a menu with the following formula:
<span class="math display">\[ U(A) = max_{x \in A}(u(x) + v(x)) - max_{y \in A}(v(y)) \]</span>
We have to estimate for each individual two preferences for each item present in
the menus.
and we estimate the WTC as the difference between the estimated values of the two
menus.</p></li>
<li><p>The cumulative temptation model.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We estimate the value with the following formula:
<span class="math display">\[ U(A) = max_{x \in A}(u(x) + v(x)) - \sum_{y \in A}(v(y)) \]</span>
This model uses the same estimation as the previous one but this time the
temptation effect of all the items of a menu is taken into account not only the
one of a particular item.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="result3" class="section level2" number="3.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Results</h2>
<p>Our analysis is based on the assumption (that we don’t test) of symmetry of the
WTC.
Indeed, we consider that if an individual is willing to pay x$ to switch from
menu A to menu B, this individual will be willing to pay -x$ to switch from
menu B to menu A.
As we consider this hypothesis to be true, we applied it as a pre-processing on
our data so that the left menu is always the larger of the two menus to compare
by modifying the WTC multiplying it by -1 when necessary.
This modification is intended to make the analysis easier to understand and does
not change the results.</p>
<p>The starting point for estimating the different economic models presented is the
estimation of individual preferences.
We will then estimate the preferences of each individual by following the method
explained.
To estimate the preferences on the singletons we use the 10 comparisons of menus
of size 1 made for each individual.
We iterate on the resulting equation system 500 times and we keep as value for
each item the average of the last 50 iterations.
Finally as we compute relative preferences, we normalize each value by
subtracting the value of the singleton {2}.
This method gives us estimates for the 6 possible singletons for
98.32% of our subjects.
An error in the programming of the experimental software has wrongly validated
strings of singletons for 1.68% of the subjects making our
estimation procedure invalid for them, so we have removed these subjects from
our study.</p>
<p>Since singletons can be seen as lotteries, we can test if subjects have
consistent preferences in terms of risks.
We consider preferences as consistent in terms of risk if the singleton {N} is
the singleton whose estimated utility is maximum then the estimated utility of
the singleton {P} is higher than that of the singleton {Q} if <span class="math inline">\(N &gt; P &gt; Q\)</span> or if
<span class="math inline">\(N &lt; P &lt; Q\)</span> i.e. single-peaked preference.</p>
<p>Among our subjects we find that
10.27% have consistent, single-peaked
preferences.
This may seem low and could call into question our method of estimating
preferences.
However, our estimates are strongly correlated with the subjects’ responses as
presented in the figure <a href="tempting-lab.html#fig:uEstim-plot3">3.1</a>.
The small number of subjects with single-peak preferences combined with the
elements presented in the next chapter concerning the difficulties of estimating
individual utility functions leads us not to try to smooth values in our
estimates.
An erroneous smoothing could be harmful to our analysis.
If this does not pose a major problem in the case of the estimation of
singletons, we will see that it is on the other hand problematic for the
estimation of the temptation effect.</p>

</div>
<p>Using the estimated utilities for the singletons and the 12 comparisons between
size 2 and size 1 menus we can estimate the temptation utility of each item for
each subject.
We iterate again 500 times on the equation system provided by the 12 comparisons
and we retain for the estimation of the relative utility of each item the
average of the last 50 iterations.
To normalize we substract to all value the estimate for the temptation element
<span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>.
We obtain estimates for each subject, but as foreseen by our design, we do not
have the estimates for each item.
The table <a href="tempting-lab.html#tab:no-estim3">3.1</a> summarizes the percentage of subjects for whom we have no
estimate by item.</p>

<p>With 37.67% of the subjects for whom 1 item has no
estimate and 13.36% for whom 2 items have no estimate.
As these missing estimates are not located on the extreme values, theoretically
it would have been easy to impute them by smoothing the estimated values with a
utility function.
But we have seen with the estimates of the singletons that such a smoothing is
not reasonable in practice, as the level of consistency is too low to make this
a meaningful exercise.
We will therefore keep this value as missing in the rest of the analysis.
But missing values do not seem to have an
important impact on the predictions of the G-P model.
Indeed, by comparing the predictions made on all the comparisons between menus
the correlation between prediction and observation is
0.45 on all the available
value and
0.47
when we restrict on observation for which we have all item estimated.
Since restriction to full estimate item menus don’t seem to have an important
impact in the analysis, in the following we willuse all available data.
The figure <a href="tempting-lab.html#fig:pref-estim-plot3">3.2</a> shows the distribution of the estimates
for each of the items.</p>
<div class="figure"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:pref-estim-plot3"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 3.2: Distribution of the estimate value of item for all subjects
</p>
</div>
<p>We can see that the estimates are of the same order of magnitude across items
and across preferences for singletons and for the temptation effect.
The estimates for singletons seem slightly lower than for temptation but this
does not seem to be a significant difference.
There are no elements that appear to be outliers in these estimates.
Using these estimates we can calculate for each of our economic models the WTC
of each comparison made by our subjects.</p>
<p>As a comparison tool to judge the quality of the predictions of our models we
estimate two statistical models, a constant response model and a regression
model.
To estimate the constant response model, we simply compute the average of the
subjects’ responses in terms of WTC for the size 1 menu comparison and for the
comparison between size 2 and size 1 menus.
The average of these 22 comparisons for each subject is the prediction for any
comparison made by this model.</p>
<p>The regression model is estimated as follows.
For each subject, a linear least square regression model is estimated with the
data concerning the size 1 menu comparisons and the size 2 menu comparisons with
size 1 menu.
The model has the following form:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
WTC = \beta_0 + \beta_1 L_2 + \beta_2 L_4 + \beta_3 L_6 + \beta_4 L_8 + 
\beta_5 L_{16} + \beta_6 L_{32} + 
\beta_7 S_2 + \beta_8 S_4 + \beta_9 S_6 + \beta_{10} S_8 + \beta_{11} S_{16}
\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(L_i\)</span> is an indicator variable for the presence of item <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> in the largest
menu and <span class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span> the same for the presence of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> in the smallest menu.
Note that our model does not contain the indicator variable <span class="math inline">\(S_{32}\)</span> because it
is a linear combination of the other variables given the menu size constraint.
The estimates of each of the model parameters for each subject are shown in the
figure <a href="tempting-lab.html#fig:reg-estim-plot3">3.3</a>.</p>
<div class="figure"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:reg-estim-plot3"></span>
<img src="_main_files/figure-html/reg-estim-plot3-1.png" alt="Distribution of the coefficent by items for all subjects" width="672" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 3.3: Distribution of the coefficent by items for all subjects
</p>
</div>
<p>We can see on the graph that the effect in the different variables of the model
are of the same order of magnitude and close to 0.
The estimated values are close to the one estimated for the economic models
especially by comparing the indicator variables for the largest menu with the
preferences for singletons and the one for the smallest menu with the estimates
of the preferences for the temptation. However, it would be premature to
interpret the coefficients of the regression as individual preferences for the
different items.
Indeed our model does not take into account the interaction between the
different variables which could be captured in the estimates of the different
coefficients by bias the the interpretation.
We can however eliminate the hypothesis that subjects evaluate a menu according
to the sum of the items that compose it.
Indeed in this situation there would be no interaction between the different
elements of a menu and we should observe that all the coefficients for the
largest menu are higher or equal to 0 and all those for the smallest menu are
lower or equal to 0, This is not the case here.</p>
<p>As our objective is to use the regression model as a tool for comparison with
other models, we will not try to interpret its coefficients at the individual
level.
We will simply compare the predictions generated by this model with the
predictions of other models and the responses of the subjects.</p>
<p>Now that we have estimated the different parameters for our 5 models, we can
compare their performances using 3 different metrics:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Mean Square Error (MSE), which is the mean square difference between the
predictions of a model and the observed values.
This metric is the default metric in many machine learning applications because
of its mathematical form and because it penalizes models with errors that are
very far from the observations.</li>
<li>Pearson correlation coefficient, which is an indicator of linear co-tendency
between two sets of values.
As our economic models are estimated from relative utility estimates, we use
this indicator to test that a model is at least consistent with the data in
terms of trend even if its predictions are biased.</li>
<li>Percentage of correct sign estimate: our study concerns preferences between
menus, so we expect a model to be able to correctly predict whether an
individual will prefer one menu to another or whether he will be indifferent
between two menus.
For each model we compute the number of times it predicts a WTC of the same sign
as the one observed<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the table <a href="tempting-lab.html#tab:models-table3">3.2</a>, we present the results of the five models according to
the three metrics, calculated on all the comparisons.</p>

<p>We see that the model that performs best by all metrics is the linear regression
model.
The constant response model is second in terms of percentage of correct sign and
MSE, which tells us that the economic models are globally poor descriptors of
the subjects’ behavior.
Among the economic models, we see that the best performing model is the G-P
model.
It is only beaten by the cumulative temptation model for the percentage of
correct sign predicted.
However, the latter model performs very poorly in terms of MSE and correlation.
Finally, if we compare the G-P model with the expected utility model, we see
that taking into account the temptation effect represents a marginal improvement
in descriptive power.
But insofar as these two models perform less well than the constant response
model, it seems unwise to use them.</p>
<p>The table <a href="tempting-lab.html#tab:comp-models-table3">3.3</a> shows the performance of each model according to the type of
comparison.
Before detailing the results, it should be remembered that the different models
were trained using the size 1 menu comparison and the size 2 menu comparison
with the size 1 menus.
These two categories represents 62.86% of the observations.</p>

<p>The first noticeable element in this table is that the different economic models
produce the same results for comparisons between menus of size 1.
The results for this type of comparison are quite good, they are far superior to
those of the constant response model and only slightly inferior to the
regression model.
On the other hand, if we look at the comparisons of size 2 menus against size 1
menus, the performance of the economic models falls below that of the constant
response model.
And this remains true for the other types of comparisons.
The linear regression model is the best model on the training data but it too
performs worse than the constant response model on the new comparison types, it
remains superior to the economic model on these data. This may indicate an
overlearning problem on the training data.</p>
<p>Now if we look at the performance of the economic models we see that the G-P
model performs better than the expected utility model.
It seems that integrating temptation in the evaluation of the comparison between
size 2 and size 1 menus allows to improve the predictions according to our 3
metrics.
But this effect does not seem to have any impact for the other types of
comparisons.
This may indicate that the improvements for the comparison between size 2 and
size 1 menus is due to an overlearning phenomenon.
It may also be a sign that the G-P model does not use the right functional form.
Indeed, alternatives to the G-P model like <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-noor2015menu" role="doc-biblioref">Noor and Takeoka</a> (<a href="#ref-noor2015menu" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> postulate that the
effect of temptation is not linear.
This could be a way to improve the performance of the model for other types of
comparisons but such a model would also be less efficient than a constant
response model for comparisons between menus of sizes 2 and 1, which therefore
does not seem to be a promising direction for improvement.
Finally, the cumulative temptation model is less efficient than the G-P model
except in predicting the sign of the WTCs, but it is still inferior to the
constant response model on this metric too.</p>
<p>We have just seen that economic models are poor descriptors of subjects’
behavior when dealing with menus of more than one option.
In the figure <a href="tempting-lab.html#fig:pred-plot3">3.4</a> we show that these models have in common to
predict that subjects are indifferent between two menus much more frequently
than what we observe.
And that this is also their main difference with the linear regression model
which has better performances.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>If the economic models often predict the value 0 – i.e., indifference between
the two compared menus – this is because they evaluate the
menus according to the preferred item they contain.
In the case of the expected utility model this implies that all menus that share the
same preferred item will have the same estimated value.
In the case of the G-P model this phenomenon is attenuated by the effect of
temptation of another menu item but remains important and the menus that share
their preferred item will have close values.
However, we observe on the comparison of the menus that subjects are rarely
indifferent between two menus.
This seems to contradict the fact that subjects evaluate menus based on a
particular item.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Discussion</h2>
<p>In this chapter we have proposed an experiment to test the temptation model
proposed in <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-gul2001temptation" role="doc-biblioref">Gul and Pesendorfer</a> (<a href="#ref-gul2001temptation" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span>.
In this chapter we have proposed an experiment that compares the descriptive
quality of the model in <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-gul2001temptation" role="doc-biblioref">Gul and Pesendorfer</a> (<a href="#ref-gul2001temptation" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span> with other economic and statistical
models.
Our test does not aim at testing the existence of a behavior predicted by the
theory as the rest of the experimental literature on the subject but at testing
the theoretical framework proposed to rationalize this behavior.
Our experiment thus allows us to highlight that the theoretical approach
proposed by G-P does not adequately account for the observed behavior of the
subjects.
We show in effect that a dummy constant response model produces predictions as
close to the observations as G-P’s model in terms of precision, tendency and
preference between menus.</p>
<p>Our experiment globally questions the menu choice approach proposed by
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-kreps1979representation" role="doc-biblioref">Kreps</a> (<a href="#ref-kreps1979representation" role="doc-biblioref">1979</a>)</span> and followed by G-P and the temptation models presented
in the review of <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-lipman2013temptation" role="doc-biblioref">Lipman, Pesendorfer, and others</a> (<a href="#ref-lipman2013temptation" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>.
These models, although an improvement over the expected utility model, are poor
descriptors of our observations.
Their specific item comparison-based approaches underestimate the
difference between two menus reported by our subjects, notably by predicting
that subjects will be indifferent between options over which subjects dare not indifferent.</p>
<p>In this respect, machine learning methods such as simple linear regressions – that take into account all elements of a menu and not just some preferred ones – are at least
better descriptors on our data than economic models.
We show in effect that a simple model trained at the individual level offers
better predictions in terms of trend predictions and preferences between menus
than the economic models and the constant response model.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it should be noted that our analysis, like the menu choice
framework, is based on expected utility theory.
And although we used the most robust estimation methods possible, it is possible
that our results are biased by a discrepancy between the observed behavior of
the subjects and that predicted by the expected utility theory.
Part of this issue will be studied in the next chapter.</p>
<p>We believe that in order to propose models with better descriptive power it
would be useful to have more information on the structure of individual errors.
This would allow us to improve the descriptive performance of risk preference
models as well as models derived from them such as the Gul-Pesendorfer model.</p>
