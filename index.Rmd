# Abstract {-}

## English version {-}

This thesis presents three experiments conducted online between 2018 and 2021. 
The first two experiments aim to test the temptation model proposed by 
@gul2001temptation (hereafter G-P). 
The first experiment studies the impact of hard and soft commitment on risk 
preferences. 
It confirms previous results in the literature whereby 
about 30% of the subjects display a demand for a commitment  and 
allows us to sehd light on the way subjects use their self-control when the limit they 
requested is not applied. <!-- when the limit is applied then there is no need for self control, right? -->
This allows us to show that asking for a constraint has the effect of reducing 
the level of risk taken by the subjects and that this reduction of risk is 
different whether the commitment is hard or soft. <!-- clearly state the result, as "different" can mean stronger or weaker; so just say "this reduction... is weaker when the commitment is soft" (or whatever our result sis, I forgot, sorry) -->
The second experiment tests the descriptive performance of the G-P model and 
compares it to the expected utility model and to two statistical models. 
This experiment shows that the G-P model is able to describe subjects' choices 
for lottery menus more accurately than the expected utility model in terms of 
precision, tendency and preferences. 
However, we show that neither model is significantly more accurate than an 
individual constant response model that does not take into account the 
composition of the menus. <!-- nor preferences, right? I mean, in a way yes, it is not a k = 32 model as in chapter 3, but can we say it does take into account preferences? Not sure... -->
The third experiment tests the stability of individuals' risk preferences. 
It shows that subjects' preferences are extremely variable both between and 
within subjects. 
This experiment shows that the choices of the subjects are not only not normally 
distributed but that they are not even distributed in such a way that their mean 
is normally distributed. <!-- maybe a sentence on why do you think this happens? serial correlation that oughtn't be there? -->
This experiment also shows that the distribution of individual choices has the 
consequence of distorting the type-I risks for statistical tests on both witin- and between-subjects experimental 
designs. <!-- again, give us the sign: it distorts in which direction? we would accept too many H0; so maybe say so, it makes it more interesting, and it uses 2-3 words more. -->
It also results in poor predictive and descriptive performance of the expected 
utility model on individual choices.
The predictions made by a model based on a CRRA-type utility function are less 
efficient than those made by a dummy model that simply predicts the average 
value over the possible interval. <!-- I would say: "predicts risk neutrality for all trials". Because this is what it is, EV maximisation (risk neutrality) wth 0 parameters utperforms a theory with one free parameter (EUT) and one with 2 (G-P) -->
Although we do not propose an explanation for these results, we show that simple
linear regression models that take into account a subject's previous choices 
perform much better than models based on a risk aversion parameter.
Overall, this thesis shows that it can be relevant to compare economic models 
with statistical reference models in order to test their descriptive or 
predictive capacity. 
This approach allows to apply the methods of comparison of models developed in 
machine learning during the last years and will allow to compare the 
contributions of economic models and machine learning models.
<!-- I don't think this is the oly contribution of your thesis, NOR the major one. 
I think that you should stress all of your contributions here. 
One is definitely the use of horse races with stats models as a sanity check for our delirious attempts at modeling in econ. Spot on, correct for you to say it, and well said. I'll be even more blunt, actually. 
BUT I thin that another major contribution is that it is HARD, very hard, to test temptation models in the lab properly. That despite all your best efforts and a design in chapt 2 that gets as close as possible to the theory, the theory fails. That we do not have to be naïve about testing theories -- it's really hard -- and that people writing theories should maybe consider the fact that making their theory testable is their job. Now, I venture a bit too far here, but I'd like you to point out at least ONE result pertaining to G-P / temptation and not only the "technical " result "use stat models if you want to be serious". The rest is actually pretty fine. -->
